# MarKompress Video

An Android app that is designed to automatically and visually lossless re-encode the videos shot on Android device and by that dramatically reduce file size and free up space. It uses an external software h.264 (x264) encoder and kicks in only when the device is charged and connected to a charger.

## Getting Started

You can get the release APK from [Google Play Store](Placeholder) or from [Releases](Placeholder) on Github.

The entire source code to build the app, including resources and tests, is available in this repository. No prerequisites needed.

## Running the tests

At the moment, the project is configured so it runs all the JVM tests before running the app. The instrumental tests are TBD.
